This is a To-Do List application built using React as part of my internship at CodeTech. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, with features like task completion, theme switching, and more.

# Features
Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks: Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete tasks they no longer need.

# Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For handling logic and interactivity.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the app.
FontAwesome: For adding icons to the UI.


# Usage
Add a Task: Use the input field to type in your task and press the "Add" button.
Complete a Task: Click on the task text to mark it as complete. This will apply a strikethrough and show a check icon.
Delete a Task: Click the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
