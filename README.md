# To-Do List Application
This is a To-Do List application built using React as part of my internship at CodeTech. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, with features like task completion, theme switching, and more.

# Features
Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks: Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete tasks they no longer need.

# Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
JavaScript (ES6+): For handling logic and interactivity.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the app.
FontAwesome: For adding icons to the UI.


# Usage
Add a Task: Use the input field to type in your task and press the "Add" button.
Complete a Task: Click on the task text to mark it as complete. This will apply a strikethrough and show a check icon.
Delete a Task: Click the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
